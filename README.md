### End-to-end text classification

In this project, we are going to learn
* Import data from web
* Perform exploratory data analysis
* Clean data suitable for efficient word embeddings like removing stop words, lemmatization etc..
* Use ml model naive bayes classifier to train on this data
* Predict the effectiveness of our classifier on new user given data
